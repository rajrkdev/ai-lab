Late Chunking inverts this: embed the WHOLE document with full attention first (using jina-embeddings-v3 with 8192 token context), then derive chunk embeddings by mean-pooling the token embeddings within chunk boundaries. Each chunk's embedding reflects global document context — solving the 'lost context' problem without an extra LLM call.",
