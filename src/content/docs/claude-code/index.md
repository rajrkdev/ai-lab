## Quick Reference

### Configuration Hierarchy (Highest → Lowest Precedence)

```
CLI flags / environment variables
    │
    ▼
~/.claude/settings.json  (user-global)
    │
    ▼
.claude/settings.json    (project-local)
    │
    ▼
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md      (user-global context)
    │
    ▼
CLAUDE.md (project root) → subdirectory CLAUDE.md files
    │
    ▼
.claude/rules/*.md       (path-scoped rules, conditional loading)
    │
    ▼
Skills / Prompts         (loaded on demand via slash commands)
```

### Key File Types

| File | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Persistent project context | Session-wide |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-global defaults | All projects |
| `.claude/rules/*.md` | Conditional rules (YAML `applyTo` glob) | Path/context scoped |
| `.claude/skills/*.md` | Reusable domain prompts | On-demand |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server definitions | Project |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Global preferences | All projects |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Project preferences (overrides global) | Project |

### Essential Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/clear` | Reset conversation (keep config) |
| `/compact` | Summarise conversation to free context |
| `/model` | Switch Claude model mid-session |
| `/plan` | Enter plan-only mode (no file writes) |
| `/memory` | View loaded CLAUDE.md content |
| `/todos` | View and manage current task list |
| `/branch` | Create a worktree branch |
| `/cost` | Show token usage and cost for session |
| `/stats` | Usage streaks and session statistics |

### Agentic Loop at a Glance

```
Your prompt
    │
    ▼  Claude generates response + optional tool_use blocks
Claude API ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    │
    ▼  check stop_reason (never parse text)
stop_reason == "tool_use"?
    │ YES                          │ NO ("end_turn")
    ▼                              ▼
Execute tools              Session complete
Append tool_result
Send back to API
    │
    └──────────────────────────────► loop
```

**Core rule:** always route on `stop_reason`, never on parsed assistant text.
