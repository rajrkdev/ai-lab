# Concept Validation Report

This document provides a detailed authenticity review of every major concept
documented in this repository. Each claim is evaluated against official
Anthropic documentation, public release notes, and the Claude Code source
changelog. Automated checks are run via the
[`validate-content` CI workflow](.github/workflows/validate-content.yml).

## Automated Validation Summary

The repository includes a CI workflow (`.github/workflows/validate-content.yml`)
that runs the following automated checks on every push and pull request:

| Check | Tool | What It Validates |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Markdown lint | markdownlint-cli | Formatting, heading structure, list style |
| Link check | lychee | All HTTP/HTTPS links in .md and .html files |
| Concept structure | `scripts/validate_concepts.py` | File references, module headings, key fact patterns |

Run the concept validation locally:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_concepts.py
```

Results are written to `concept-validation-results.json` (gitignored).

| **Total** | **101** | **11** | **7** | **119** |

**85%** of claims are fully verified against official Anthropic documentation or
independent public sources. **9%** are broadly accurate with caveats or where
only approximations are available. **6%** cannot be independently verified from
public sources (primarily vendor case-study figures and marketing statistics).

No claims were found to be factually incorrect. The unverifiable items are
either vendor-reported performance metrics, specific version numbers that
predate the public changelog, or statistics whose source could not be traced
to a primary document.
